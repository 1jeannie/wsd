				<h2> Florida's Birds of Prey </h2>
				<p> Florida has many birds of prey, they include eagles, hawks, owls, ospreys, vultures, kites, falcons
				and others.  Birds of prey are distinguished by their hooked bill and sharp talons (claws).  They capture,
				kill and eat other animals.  Thus, they are <em>"raptors"</em> a word that comes from the latin, meaning <strong>"to seize
				and carry away"</strong>. Most birds of prey will nest anywhere they have a desired food supply.  For example, the Osprey
				prefers fish, and will nest near a water source. </p>
				<p> While some raptors can be elusive, opportunities exist around the state to see these birds both in captivity
				and in the wild.  There are many very good, local and online resources available to assist in your birdwatching, from the types of
				equipment needed, to locations, tours, and best times of year, day etc. to maximize your experience. </p>
				<p> I encourage you to get out there and see them for yourself, they are a spectacular natural resource.
				And, don't forget the sunscreen and the bug spray, it is Florida! </p>
