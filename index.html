		<h1> Florida's Birds of Prey </h1>
		<p> Florida has many birds of prey, they include eagles, hawks, owls, ospreys, vultures, kites, falcons
		and others.  Birds of prey are distinguished by their hooked bill and sharp talons (claws).  They capture,
		kill and eat other animals.  Thus, they are "raptors" a word that comes from the latin, meaning "to seize
		and carry away". </p>
		<h2> Habitat Choice </h2>
		Most birds of prey will nest anywhere they have a desired food supply.  For example the Osprey prefers
		fish, and will nest near a water source.
