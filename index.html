				<h2> Florida's Birds of Prey </h2>
				<p> Florida has many birds of prey, they include eagles, hawks, owls, ospreys, vultures, kites, falcons
				and others.  Birds of prey are distinguished by their hooked bill and sharp talons (claws).  They capture,
				kill and eat other animals.  Thus, they are <em>"raptors"</em> a word that comes from the latin, meaning <strong>"to seize
				and carry away"</strong>. Most birds of prey will nest anywhere they have a desired food supply.  For example, the Osprey
				prefers fish, and will nest near a water source. </p>
